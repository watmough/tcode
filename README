This program reads from standard input and prefixes each line read with the 
elapsed time in hours:minutes:seconds, from when the program was started.

You might want to use this to add a time code to ICYCast/Shoutcast song titles
that are output from mplayer when downloading an internet stream, as it does not
appear to preserve the ICYCast data when dumping the stream.

OS X Usage:
 
#!/bin/sh
/Library/Application\ Support/ffmpegX/mplayer -dumpstream <STREAM> -dumpfile `date "+%Y%m%d"`_<NAME>.pls | ./tcode
